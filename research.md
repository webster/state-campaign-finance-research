# State-by-State Campaign Finance Research

This is a compliation of research of state-by-state campaign finance information technology systems surrounding disclosures, filings, and complaints.  My wish is that every state (and county within it) have fully-accessible and electronic filing for candidates, which result in searchable, machine-readable data.  Unfortunately, I know a lot of states disclose only imaged paper forms as PDFs, rendering them mostly unusable.
