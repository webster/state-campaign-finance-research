# State-by-State Campaign Finance Research
This is a compliation of research of state-by-state campaign finance information technology systems surrounding disclosures, filings, and complaints.  Ideally every jurisdiction would have fully electronic data with comprehensive search capabilities, JSON API endpoints, exportable files, and more... but many jurisdictions have little to no search capabilities or imaged paper forms manually uploaded to a server.

## Colorado
Colorado has an advanced and complex campaign finance reporting system named TRACER. It allows public searches by candidate, committee, contribution, expenditure, loan, penalty, complaint, race, registered agent, etc. It handles all races in all jurisdictions in the state. Committees can register online and are assigned a unique ID. Contributions can be uploaded using an "Electronic Data Interchange" (EDI) XML reporting specification. Nearly every search result page and report data page can be exported as CSV, XLS, PDF. Additionally, the SOS provides the ability to download [all contributions, expenditures and loans for all campaigns as zipped CSVs](http://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/PublicSite/DataDownload.aspx?CSRT=5610696337510576946). A 2008 RFP was awarded to Quest Information Systems to customize their FirstTuesday software. The amount of money is unknown, but there was an appropriation of $1,478,968 for FY08-09 to develop the software, plus an ongoing hosting charge.

    * Public analysis tools
        * Several reporting tools are available, such as overdue reports, contributions by employer, zipcode, etc. Advanced queries can be exported as XML, CSV, PDF, TIFF, MHTML web archive, Excel XLS, Word, or Image JPEG. These reports seem to group by name at best, and don't generate any graphical depictions.
    * Committee Filing
        * Electronic filing accepted via [TRACER](http://tracer.sos.colorado.gov/). "The Secretary of Stateâ€™s office provides three ways to file campaign finance information electronically. You may submit information via regular data entry directly into TRACER; via electronic data interchange (EDI) with pre-approved Excel spreadsheets; or via EDI with XML. All filers may use EDI, but the technical requirements of EDI make it more practical for committees with very large numbers of contributions and expenditures. EDI enables the management of contributions and expenditures using specific spreadsheet templates or XML prior to report filing. Please contact the Campaign Finance Support Team at cpfhelp@sos.state.co.us for more information on EDI filing."

    * Authority: State candidates, state PACs
    * Public Searches
        * Search by committee name: YES
        * Search by contributor name: YES, very poor UI

    * Committee Filing
        * Accepts electronic filing using required [Campaign Finance Reporter Software](http://www.cfboard.state.mn.us/software/index.html) which runs on Windows XP only. The software syncs with the CF Board's servers, and automatically identifies violations such as overcontributions or name-matches to lobbyists prohibited from contributing. Seems to be a heavily-manual process.
    * Complaints
        * Listed by date, but not searchable

* County and municipal filings are handled by counties. Hennepin County, for example, has an image PDF "database" but Ramsey County appears to just manually update a page with linked image PDFs. Many counties have no online presence, most likely requiring in-person visits.
