This is an example of something that a filer might want to send to the FEC.
There are a few lines of text followed by some columns of information.

  Line            Description             Amount
  ----            -----------             ------
    1             Line One                  1.00
    2             Line Two                 20.00
    3             Line Three              300.00

The table above means nothing, but serves as an example of how a filer could
send something electronically to the FEC and have the document tracked in the
same way that any other kind of filing would be tracked.
